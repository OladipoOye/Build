# Build
My refined coding and web development projects.

Split into 3 key sections:
- Next_js is my folder for web development using react, self-learnt in the latter half of 2024. Specifically Next_js applications, and mainly styled using chakra ui. In here we see a combination of concept websites, and a restyling of a static website built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, that I built for my youth church.

- numerical_simulations is my folder for numerical simulations, assembled after experiencing my first year modules in maths and mechanical vibrations.

- vanilla_js is my folder for my initial web development projects, implemented in the summer of my first year and built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (which I also learnt that summer). Here we get to see my deployed website, built for the Girton Engineering Society "https://girtonengsoc.co.uk" in its development stage.

- performance_projects gives my performance simulations (currently for large aircrafts, however I'm hoping to expand this further to automotive interests also)

Please feel free to go through my projects, and by all means download them and test out the magic for yourself. These were created out of my own personal experriences and passion for programming, and it would be my pleasure if it creates intruige, or can be used productively.
