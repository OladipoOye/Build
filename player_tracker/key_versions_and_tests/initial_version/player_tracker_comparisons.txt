First comparison - easy stats for basketball
- Simple interface, direct application of stats
- Emails players/parents stats after games
- Completely free, however stats have to be manually input in real time

Second Comparison - Breakthrough stats
Broader range of stats, not free at all
- Similar structure, but also tracks player weight and team colour, and expands to league
- Good/important overview when opening the app

Third Comparison - Hoopmetrics
- Broad range of stats
- Position tracked field goals, and backed up data

Takeaways from these - expand team/player features 
1.Maybe include a year (2025?) attribute for players, this can be input into the SeasonPlayer class so that you can compare to last year, or have a yearly based incentive/send off/message
2.Have a clear ui overview/introduction
3.Have a number attribute for players - could add to id, make it better for users
4.Possibly look to add a field goal class - would be added to the game class, and would allow for field goal scoring positions analysis, but this could also make the app unnecesarily complex
5.Would be better if implementing the field goal class under a screen tap feature, as it would prevent manually typing out all of the positions that someone scored
6.Find a way also of storing the player data
